                    <dt>Mercury - Acts 1 & 2 (July 1,2022)</dt>
                    <dd>I like this album because that is the first album that I really like all the songs, there is some songs that even got more popular for tiktoks and all the jokes that the poeple created it with some specifics songs.</dd>
                    <dt>Evolve (June 23, 2017)</dt>
                    <dd>This Album was the first album that I heard from them. I listened on a comercial for the Nintendo Switch console,it was the song called "believer" and it was some people playing and enjoying the games. From that moment I start to like and keep listen their songs.</dd>
                    <dt>Origins (November 9, 2018)</dt>
                    <dd>this is the top 3 album that I like from Imagine Dragons, there is some songs that I like but it is more relaxing and the rock part that they normally do on their songs.</dd>
